
WarpSpeed V2.0

If you look at the schematic at the end of the manual, you'll
notice that some of the address and data lines do not match
between the Expansion Bus and the EPROM. The WarpSpeed team
probably did this to make the layout of the PCB easier.

When you read the EPROM under normal conditions, the code
will be mixed up and unreadable when you try to dis-
assemble it.

If you layout a PCB the same as the WarpSpeed PCB, then
you will have to use the scrambled code in your EPROM.
