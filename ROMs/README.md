# WarpSpeed ROM Images

## Raw Images
The [Raw](Raw/) directory contains *raw* images. These images are sort of "scrambled", probably in order to avoid having to manufacture a board with vias, which (I guess) was rather expensive in the '80s/'90s.

These images MUST be used with the *original* branch/releases of this project.

## Unscrambled Images
Luckily, some people managed to unscramble the ROMS, reordering the bits and address lines. The decoder program, with credits, is included in the [Decoder](Decoder/) directory.

The images in the [Unscrambled](Unscrambled/) directory MUST be used with the *master* branch/releases of this project.

ROMs and Decoder in this folder were retrieved from https://rr.pokefinder.org/wiki/WarpSpeed
